# acmt: Air Column Modeling Toolkit in Matlab
## by Gary Scavone, McGill University.

This repository contains Matlab scripts that implement both the Transfer Matrix Method and Digital Waveguide methods for acoustic modeling. Instrument definition files are in the [geometries/](geometries) directory. Example usage files are in the [examples/](examples) directory.

## Abstract from Acoustical Society of America Presentation on 15 May 2024:
Digital waveguide methods for time-domain modeling of acoustic structures comprised of interconnected piece-wise one-dimensional cylinders, cones and toneholes have been well reported in the past. In this work, an open-source Matlab class is presented that can be used to model arbitrary wind instrument air column structures, defined by length, radii and hole geometric parameters, using digital waveguide methods. Fractional-delay filtering can be enabled or disabled, with support for both Thiran and Lagrange filter types of specified order. Thermoviscous losses can be modeling using either a discrete-time least squares or a shelf-filter fit, both of arbitrary order. Three different tonehole model options are provided (two-port, three-port or wave digital filter). End boundary conditions include closed, anechoic, ideally open, open flanged and open unflanged. The class object can be used either in single-sample iterative contexts (for example, with an attached excitation model) or with arbitrarily-sized input signals (for example, to compute a reflection function or impedance). The modeled geometry can be constructed manually by iteratively adding segments or holes, or a complete geometry can be specified in a file. This project is bundled together with a parallel and previously reported open-source project for frequency-domain transfer matrix modeling of air columns.
